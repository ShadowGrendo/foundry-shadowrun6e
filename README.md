# A FoundryVTT System Module for Shadowrun 6th World

This system module implements Shadowrun 6th Worldâ€‹ (edition) for FoundryVTT. 

## Status!

I'm actively developing this for the game I'm in. It is technically a fork of the 5th edition and foundry-shadowrun6e repository, but code-wise, I've started from the ground up. 

Currently the only implemented thing is part of the player character sheet, but stay tuned to the master branch.
